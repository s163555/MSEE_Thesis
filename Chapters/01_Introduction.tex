\chapter{Introduction}
The progress of imaging internal organs has advanced significantly during the \nth{20} century. Three major technologies used are X-ray, \gls{mri}, and ultrasound. Each of the technologies have distinct advantages and disadvantages in biomedical imaging, thus are still relevant for modern medicine. With x-rays, an important drawback is that patients are exposed to ionizing radiation

This template complies with the DTU Design Guide \url{https://www.designguide.dtu.dk/}. DTU holds all rights to the design program including all copyrights. It is intended for two-sided printing. The \textbackslash \texttt{cleardoublepage} command can be used to ensure that new sections and the table of contents begins on a right-hand page. The back page always ends as an odd page. \cite{Jensen_Analysis_PW_1996}

All document settings have been collected in Setup/Settings.tex. These are global settings, meaning the settings will affect the whole document. Defining the title for example will change the title on the front page, the copyright page, and the footer. A watermark can be enabled or disabled in Setup/Premeable.tex. You can edit the watermark to display draft, review, approve, confidential, or anything else. By default, the watermark is printed on top of the document's contents and has a transparent gray color. Here I am just testing the synchronization functionality of Overleaf and Github. Now, that the first synchronization finished successfully, I want to test that the reverse direction process is also functional. Hopefully, this will end up on Overleaf.

\section{This is a section}
Every chapter is numbered and the sections inherit the chapter number followed by a dot and a section number. Figures, equations, tables, etc. also inherit the chapter numbering. 

\subsection{This is a sub section}
Sub-sections are also numbered. In general, try not to use a deep hierarchy of sub-sections (\texttt{\textbackslash paragraph\{\}} and the like). The document will become segmented, which will make the document appear less coherent. 

\subsubsection{This is a sub sub section}
And those are not numbered. It is possible to adjust the deep hierarchy of numbering sections in Setup/Settings.tex. 

The front and back cover has been made to replicate the examples in the design guide \url{https://www.designguide.dtu.dk/#stnd-printmedia}. The name of department heading is omitted because it is located in the top right corner (no need to write it twice). Take a look at \url{https://www.inside.dtu.dk/en/medarbejder/om-dtu-campus-og-bygninger/kommunikation-og-design/skabeloner/rapporter} if you want to make your cover separately. 

Citing is done with the \texttt{biblatex} package \cite{1999_SummerSchool_Notes}. Cross referencing (figures, tables, etc.) is taken care by the \texttt{cleveref} package. Just insert the name of the label in \textbackslash \texttt{cref\{\}} and it will automatically format the cross-reference. For example, writing the \texttt{cleveref} command \textbackslash \texttt{cref\{fig:groupedcolumn\}} will output ``\cref{fig:groupedcolumn}''. Using \textbackslash \texttt{Cref\{\}} will capitalize the first letter and \textbackslash \texttt{crefrange\{\}\{\}} will make a reference range. An example: \Cref{fig:stackedbar} is an example of a stacked bar chart and \crefrange{fig:stackedcolumn}{fig:groupedcolumn} are three consecutive figures.

\section{Font and symbols test}
Symbols can be written directly in the document, meaning that there is no need for special commands to write special characters. I love to write special characters like æøå inside my \TeX{} document. Also á, à, ü, û, ë, ê, î, ï could be nice. So what about the ``¿'' character. What about ° é ® † ¥ ü | œ ‘ @ ö ä ¬ ‹ « © ƒ ß ª … ç ñ µ ‚ · ¡ “ £ ™ [ ] '. Some dashes - – —, and the latex form - -- ---

\gls{high}, \gls{low}, \gls{spice}

% Given a set of numbers, there are elementary methods to compute its \glsxtrlong{gcd}, which is abbreviated \glsxtrshort{gcd}. This process is similar to that used for \acrfull{lcm}.

I want to talk about \gls{spice}, \gls{high} and \gls{low}. These are all \gls{dc} and \gls{ac} electric principles. I want to mention that \glsxtrlong{fet} devices can be called \glsxtrshort{fet}.

I like to talk about logic systems and their binary states. Such as \gls{high} and \gls{low}. These are also important in \gls{spice} simulation systems.

I like to explain abbreviations such as \glsxtrshort{fet}. This abbreviation stands for \glsxtrlong{fet}. I like this paper \cite{Omura2022}.
