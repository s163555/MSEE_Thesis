\section{Introduction}
Welcome to the latest release of Gummi - the simple {\LaTeX} editor. After a long break in development, we're finally back with version 0.8.0.\\
With this release we say farewell to the GTK2 toolkit and mark the beginning of the use of GTK3 within our codebase. Many other improvements were also made to enhance your Gummi experience. For a complete list of changes, please see our changelog\footnote{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexandervdm/gummi/master/ChangeLog}. 

I would like to test the instant rendering engine in Gummi.
