\chapter{Production}
In this chapter, the steps involved in turning a theoretical design into a tangible system will be outlined. Since the synthesis chapter dealt with a explanations of the functions of each module and simulations, with a subsequent evaluation of the outcomes, this chapter will focus on the creation of physical hardware setups and reproducing the desired results using lab experiments. As such, each module will be tested independently to validate its function before a larger, more comprehensive experiment is conducted.
\section{Control System}

\section{Power Stage}

\end{figure}
A picture of the power stage PCB can be seen in \cref{fig:4_transmitter_pcb_pic}. An experiment is conducted to validate the function of the power stage. Using the jumpers, the PCB is configured without its onboard load, and a \gls{pzt} transducer is attached with a splitter adapter to connect the other side to an oscilloscope for data acquisition. Seen in \cref{fig:4_transmitter_meas} are actual measured inputs and outputs of the power stage. On the input, there are two complementary \qty{5}{\mega\hertz} signals with varying duty cycle to generate the desired dead-time. On the output, we see the rail-to-rail push-pull operation of the \gls{mosfet} half-bridge. The schematic of the transmitter can be found in the appendix in \cref{fig:appendix_md1213db1}. Noticeable noise is observed in the input signal top and base, but is negligible for the successful operation. Possibly, the noise is due to a cable and adapter problem.

\section{Transmit/Receive Switch}

\end{figure}
The entire schematic of the transmit/receive switch can be found in the appendix in \cref{fig:appendix_ultrasoundswitch_a,fig:appendix_ultrasoundswitch_b}. As mentioned in the previous chapter, a PCB layout was made and a batch of 5 was ordered with an accompanying stencil for fast assembly. After the PCBs arrived, the stencil was mounted in the stencil frame and the PCB aligned for solder paste application. After solder paste application is completed, all the components are placed on their corresponding footprints and the PCB is placed in the reflow oven. The equipment used in this process is listed in \cref{tab:instruments_solder_work}. The finished assembly can be seen in \cref{fig:4_txrx_pcb}.

	\label{fig:4_switch_meas_pic}
\end{figure}
For validating the TX/RX switch, an experiment is conducted with a \gls{pzt} transducer, water tank, function generator and an oscilloscope. Using two input signals, $f_{\mathrm{prf}}=\qty{10}{\kilo\hertz}$ switch signal, and $f_{0}=\qty{5}{\mega\hertz}$ burst mode transmit signal, the switch is configured to transmit and receive. A picture of the submerged transducer with a reflector can be seen in \cref{fig:4_switch_meas_pic}. After submerging the transducer in distilled water and measuring on the receiver side of the TX/RX switch, a reflected signal from the tank can be observed in \cref{fig:4_txrx_meas}.
