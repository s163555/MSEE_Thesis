  ABSTRACT = {Pulsed wave ultrasound systems can be used for determining blood's velocity non-invasively in the body. A region of interest is selected, and the received signal is range gated to measure data from the region. One complex sample value is acquired for each pulse emission after complex demodulation of the received signal. The time evolution and distribution of velocity can then be found by using samples from a number of pulse-echo lines. Making a short-time Fourier transform of the data reveals the velocity distribution in the range gate over time.},

@ARTICLE{Jensen_Algorithms,
  ABSTRACT = {Ultrasound has been used intensively for the last 15years for studying the hemodynamics of the human body. Systems for determining both the velocity distribution at one point of interest (spectral systems) and for displaying a map of velocity in real time have been constructed. A number of schemes have been developed for performing the estimation, and the various approaches are described. The current systems only display the velocity along the ultrasound beam direction and a velocity transverse to the beam is not detected. This is a major problem in these systems, since most blood vessels are parallel to the skin surface. Angling the transducer will often disturb the flow, and new techniques for finding transverse velocities are needed. The various approaches for determining transverse velocities will be explained. This includes techniques using two-dimensional correlation (speckle tracking), multiple beams, and the new transverse modulation technique. The different advantages and disadvantages of the approaches are explained.},

@ARTICLE{Jansson_Estimation_Perfusion,
  ABSTRACT = {<p>Ways to measure blood perfusion using ultrasound techniques such as continuous-wave Doppler, pulsed Doppler, colour Doppler and power Doppler will be reviewed. From a certain standpoint, blood perfusion may be defined as the difference between arterial inflow and arterial outflow from a considered volume, i.e. capillary flow. The low velocities and small blood volumes involved make the signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range and frequency resolution critical factors in the detection system. Another limiting factor is tissue motion which obscures the blood signal. Perfusion may still under certain conditions be estimated with the first moment of the Doppler power spectrum, as obtained with any Doppler ultrasound method. Modern flow mapping techniques also make it possible to estimate perfusion by counting the number of pixels that indicate flow, but low flow velocities cannot be included in the estimate. Future high-frequency systems may, however, provide very detailed images of minute flow distributions in superficial layers. Contrast agents are widely used today to enhance the blood signal, and a technique named harmonic imaging can suppress movement artefacts from surrounding tissue. Transient signals from disrupting contrast agent particles in an ultrasound field can potentially be used for perfusion quantification. Future developments to extract the blood flow signal from its noisy environment, aside from contrast agents, may be multiple sample volumes, frequency compounding and/or improved signal processing. The lack of an adequate perfusion phantom for verification of measurements of microcirculatory flow becomes, however, more apparent with improved detectability of slow flows.</p>},

@ARTICLE{Hoskins_Review_Blood_Velocity,
  ABSTRACT = {Ultrasound systems can be used to investigate blood flow by use of the Doppler effect. The flow information may be displayed as either a real-time sonogram or a two-dimensional colour image. Estimates of maximum velocity using commercial systems are in error by typically 10–100 per cent; this is associated with the inability of the single-beam Doppler method to measure the true direction of flow, and with geometric spectral broadening. Vector Doppler systems acquire Doppler information along two beam directions and are able to measure accurately the velocity and direction of motion within the scan plane. The small beam width of modern Doppler systems means that the condition of uniform insonation, required for estimation of mean velocity from mean frequency shift, is not valid except for the very smallest vessels. Other quantities related to the velocity may also be estimated, such as the volumetric flow and wall shear stress. Flow visualization using colour flow imaging suffers from dependence of the displayed colour on the direction of blood motion. The vector Doppler technique may be extended to colour flow to give improved visualization of flow, in which there is no angle dependence within the scan plane.},

@THESIS{diianniT_Thesis,
  ABSTRACT = {This PhD project investigates hardware strategies and imaging methods for hand-held ultrasound systems. The overall idea is to use a wireless ultrasound probe linked to general-purpose mobile devices for the processing and visualization. The approach has the potential to reduce the upfront costs of the ultrasound system and, consequently, to allow for a wide-scale utilization of diagnostic ultrasound in any medical specialties and out of the radiology department. The first part of the contribution deals with the study of hardware solutions for the reduction of the system complexity. Analog and digital beamforming strategies are simulated from a system-level perspective. The quality of the B-mode image is evaluated and the minimum specifications are derived for the design of a portable probe with integrated electronics in-handle. The system is based on a synthetic aperture sequential beamforming approach that allows to significantly reduce the data rate between the probe and processing unit. The second part investigates the feasibility of vector flow imaging in a hand-held ultrasound system. Vector flow imaging overcomes the limitations of conventional imaging methods in terms of flow angle compensation. Furthermore, high frame rate can be obtained by using synthetic aperture focusing techniques. A method is developed combining synthetic aperture sequential beamforming and directional transverse oscillation to achieve the wireless transmission of the data along with a relatively inexpensive 2-D velocity estimation. The performance of the method is thoroughly assessed through simulations and measurements, and in vivo investigations are carried out to show its potential in presence of complex flow dynamics. A sufficient frame rate is achieved to allow for the visualization of vortices in the carotid bifurcation. Furthermore, the method is implemented on a commercially available tablet to evaluate the real-time processing performance in the built-in GPU with concurrent wireless transmission of the data. Based on the demonstrations in this thesis, a flexible framework can be implemented with performance that can be scaled to the needs of the user and according to the computing resources available. The integration of high-frame-rate vector flow imaging in a hand-held ultrasound scanner, in addition, has the potential to improve the operators workflow and opens the way to new possibilities in the clinical practice.},

@THESIS{Olesen_Thesis,
  ABSTRACT = {The main purpose of this PhD project was to develop an ultrasonic method capable of determining intravascular pressure changes non-invasively. Measuring pressure variations is used clinically as a diagnostic marker for the physiological state of a cardiovascular region. Current clinical procedures for assessing pressure changes are by means of invasive devices such as pressure sensing catheters. Such devices suffer severe limitations as they are invasive and require the use of ionizing radiation for guidance and positioning. To overcome the concerns related to the use of invasive pressure catheters this project introduces a method that derives pressure changes from 2-D vector velocity flow data acquired non-invasively. The method is based on the Navier-Stokes equations and is tested on fabricated flow models. Results from the flow models are compared with simulations from finite element modeling. The developed technique showed a standard deviation and bias across constricted flow domains of 9 % and 8 %, respectively. Finally, the first in-vivo examples of deriving pressure changes from 2-D vector velocity ultrasound data is presented. Based on the presented results it is concluded that non-invasive determination of pressure changes from 2-D flow data is feasible. However, when transferring the method into clinical practice, where blood vessels follow more complex flow geometries, the influence of out-of-plane flow movement becomes increasingly more important. Therefore, for scans using a 1-D transducer it is crucial that the out-of-plane flow component is negligible.},

@THESIS{BrandtA_Thesis,
  ABSTRACT = {This Ph.D. project is based on a longstanding collaboration between physicists and engineers from the Center of Fast Ultrasound Imaging (CFU) at the Technical University of Denmark and medical doctors from the department of Radiology at Rigshospitalet. The intent of this cooperation is to validate new ultrasonic methods for future clinical use. Study I compares two B-mode ultrasound methods: the new experimental technique Synthetic Aperture Sequential Beamforming combined with Tissue Harmonic Imaging (SASB-THI), and a conventional technique combined with THI. While SASB reduces the amount of data transformation, thus enabling wireless transmission, THI can improve resolution and image contrast, and creates fewer artifacts. Thirty-one patients with verified liver tumors were scanned and recordings with and without visible pathology were performed. Subsequently, eight radiologists evaluated blinded to information about the technique, which B-mode images they preferred, as well as detection of pathology. Evaluation showed that the techniques were preferred equally and tumor could be detected equally well.Study II deals with the ability of vector flow imaging (VFI) to monitor patients with arteriovenous fistulas for hemodialysis for upcoming stenosis. VFI is an angle-independent method for determining blood flow direction and velocity. Volume can be determined by integrating the velocity profile multiplied by the cross-sectional area. Nineteen patients were monitored monthly over a period of six months, and VFI estimates were compared with the reference ultrasound dilution technique (UDT). VFI volume flow values were not significantly different from UDT and had a better precision. Concordance between VFI and UDT was high when large volume flow changes (greater than 25%) occurred between dialysis sessions. However, the methods could not be regarded as interchangeable. Study III deals with VFIs ability to determine peak velocity in the portal vein. The commonly used ultrasound method for this is spectral Doppler, which is known to overestimate peak velocity when the angle between the blood vessel and the beam is more than 70 degrees; this overestimation becomes even larger when the angle becomeslarger. VFI can determine the peak velocity angle independently. Thirty-two healthy volunteers were scanned with spectral Doppler and VFI with two portal vein scan positions (intercostal and subcostal). The study showed that VFI estimates the same peak velocity as spectral Doppler. Furthermore, VFI has better precision and can estimate the same peak velocity with a scan position, where spectral Doppler cannot. Finally, inter- and intraobserver agreement is higher for VFI. All three studies indicate that the techniques can be used in the clinic and probably will be part of everyday practice in the near future.},

@THESIS{2D_Velocity_Estimation_Phase,
  ABSTRACT = {In this PhD thesis a method for 2-D blood velocity estimation called the transverse oscillation method (TO) is investigated. The thesis is divided into two parts. In the first part the basic principles in conventional 1-D flow estimation are described, and the state of the art for 2-D velocity estimation is discussed. The TO method is introduced, and the basic theory behind the method is explained. This includes the creation of the acoustic fields, beamforming, echo-canceling and the velocity estimator.In the second part of the thesis the eight papers produced during this PhD project are presented. Here the TO method is tested both in simulations using the Field II program and in flow phantom experiments using the RASMUS scanner. Both simulations and flow phantom experiments indicate that the TO method can estimate the 2-D vector velocity with an acceptable low bias and standard deviation when the angle between the blood and the ultrasound beam is above 50^. Furthermore, the TO method is tested in-vivo where the scannings are performed by skilled sonographers. The in-vivo scannings resulted in a sequence of 2-D vector CFM images which showed 2-D flow patterns in the bifurcation of the carotid artery.},

@THESIS{Ramin_Automatic_Ultrasound,
  ABSTRACT = {Medical ultrasound has been a widely used imaging modality in healthcare platforms for examination, diagnostic purposes, and for real-time guidance during surgery. However, despite the recent advances, medical ultrasound remains the most operator-dependent imaging modality, as it heavily relies on the user adjustments on the scanner interface to optimize the scan settings. This explains the huge interest in the subject of this PhD project entitled “AUTOMATIC ULTRASOUND SCANNING”. The key goals of the project have been to develop automated techniques to minimize the unnecessary settings on the scanners, and to improve the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in ultrasound by introducing new quantitative measures. Thus, four major issues concerning automation of the medicalultrasound are addressed in this PhD project. They touch upon gain adjustments in ultrasound, automatic synthetic aperture image quality optimization, automated vessel segmentation in ultrasound, and lack of CAD in point-of-care lung ultrasound. The goals of this PhD are achieved for each of the subjects. First, a new automated time gain compensation technique is proposed that compensates for gains of the scans in 2-D. The proposed model outperforms the current 1-D curve compensation in commercial scanners, as the 2-D topology of the scans are not fully integrated in those techniques.Second, an automated generic technique is proposed for optimization of synthetic aperture image quality. This generic model can be used for any imaging regime using any transducer geometry. Third, a hybrid vessel segmentation technique is proposed that combines both vector velocity estimates (VFI) and B-mode images. The technique enables the wall-to-wall visualization of VFI, as well as provides a firm ground for quantitative quantification of VFI in state-of-the-art US scanners. Finally, a new technique is introduced to detect disease-related reverberation artifacts in lung ultrasound, thereby exploiting the full potential of this imaging modality.},

@INPROCEEDINGS{Hall_Wall_Filter,
  ABSTRACT = {In medical ultrasound, flow velocity estimation for blood flow imaging (color flow) relies on first filtering out signals due to stationary scatterers so that a simple autocorrelation frequency estimator can be used to determine flow. Usually, this “wall filter” is implemented as either a conventional FIR or IIR filter. Unfortunately, in the case of very low velocity flow, these wall filters may remove signals from the moving scatterers of interest. In this work we present a novel filtering scheme that involves first shifting (via a complex multiplication) the undesired signals to zero frequency and then removing these signals by simply subtracting the average of these signals from each of them. The result is a high-pass filter which is very narrow, yet does not reduce the number of samples available to the autocorrelation velocity estimator},

  ABSTRACT = {The ultrasonic volumetric scattering cross section of the erythrocyte has been measured over a range of frequencies by comparing the rms value of the gated backscattered signal from the blood with that of a wave reflected from a flat reflector with known reflection coefficient. It is found to be proportional to the fourth power of the frequency predicted by the wave scattering theory for small particles in the frequency range from 5 MHz to 15 MHz. The relation between the scattering coefficient and the hematocrit is also examined up to a hematocrit of 45 percent. This coefficient is found to increase along with the hematocrit until it reaches a maximum around hematocrit = 26 percent and then decreases as the hematocrit increases. Twersky's wave scattering theory is applied to describe this result.},

@ARTICLE{Fish_Ultrasonic,
  ABSTRACT = {Ultrasound and the Doppler effect are used to measure blood velocity non-invasively in order to diagnose blood vessel disease. Intrusive lesions on arterial walls give rise to an alteration of the time-varying blood velocity waveform and local blood flow disturbance which are detected and measured using the envelope and width of the Doppler signal spectrogram respectively. Flow may also be imaged in colour superimposed on a grey-scale anatomical image allowing vessel narrowing and the accompanying flow disturbance to be visualized. Developments in three-dimensional imaging, angle tolerant velocity measurements and increased sensitivity using second harmonic backscatter from encapsulated-bubble contrast media ensure increasing use of this modality.},

@ARTICLE{Hoskins2010,
  ABSTRACT = {Visualization of, and measurements related to, haemodynamic phenomena in arteries may be made using ultrasound systems. Most ultrasound technology relies on simple measurements of blood velocity taken from a single site, such as the peak systolic velocity for assessment of the degree of lumen reduction caused by an arterial stenosis. Real-time two-dimensional (2D) flow field visualization is possible using several methods, such as colour flow, blood flow imaging, and echo particle image velocimetry; these have applications in the examination of the flow field in diseased arteries and in heart chambers. Three-dimensional (3D) and four-dimensional ultrasound systems have been described. These have been used to provide 2D velocity profile data for the estimation of volumetric flow. However, they are limited for haemodynamic evaluation in that they provide only one component of the velocity. The provision of all seven components (three space, three velocity, and one time) is possible using image-guided modelling, in which 3D ultrasound is combined with computational fluid dynamics. This method also allows estimation of turbulence data and of relevant quantities such as the wall shear stress.},

@ARTICLE{Wells1998,
  ABSTRACT = {Ultrasonic Doppler methods are routinely used to study the vascular system. Flow and tissue motion information can be obtained by frequency and time domain processing. Instruments range in complexity from simple continuous wave devices without imaging capability through to advanced real-time 2D colour flow scanners and intravascular devices. 3D display is also possible. Contrast agents can be used to increase the detectability of blood flow signals. The properties of the tissue impose an envelope on achievable ultrasonic imaging. Doppler studies can provide information about flow velocity profile, vessel compliance, wall shear rate, pressure gradient, perfusion, tumour blood flow and the presence of emboli. These capabilities can be integrated in an holistic picture of ultrasonic vascular studies.},
