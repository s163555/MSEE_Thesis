   abstract = {Ultrasound has been used intensively for the last 15years for studying the hemodynamics of the human body. Systems for determining both the velocity distribution at one point of interest (spectral systems) and for displaying a map of velocity in real time have been constructed. A number of schemes have been developed for performing the estimation, and the various approaches are described. The current systems only display the velocity along the ultrasound beam direction and a velocity transverse to the beam is not detected. This is a major problem in these systems, since most blood vessels are parallel to the skin surface. Angling the transducer will often disturb the flow, and new techniques for finding transverse velocities are needed. The various approaches for determining transverse velocities will be explained. This includes techniques using two-dimensional correlation (speckle tracking), multiple beams, and the new transverse modulation technique. The different advantages and disadvantages of the approaches are explained.},

@article{Jansson_Estimation_Perfusion,
   abstract = {<p>Ways to measure blood perfusion using ultrasound techniques such as continuous-wave Doppler, pulsed Doppler, colour Doppler and power Doppler will be reviewed. From a certain standpoint, blood perfusion may be defined as the difference between arterial inflow and arterial outflow from a considered volume, i.e. capillary flow. The low velocities and small blood volumes involved make the signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range and frequency resolution critical factors in the detection system. Another limiting factor is tissue motion which obscures the blood signal. Perfusion may still under certain conditions be estimated with the first moment of the Doppler power spectrum, as obtained with any Doppler ultrasound method. Modern flow mapping techniques also make it possible to estimate perfusion by counting the number of pixels that indicate flow, but low flow velocities cannot be included in the estimate. Future high-frequency systems may, however, provide very detailed images of minute flow distributions in superficial layers. Contrast agents are widely used today to enhance the blood signal, and a technique named harmonic imaging can suppress movement artefacts from surrounding tissue. Transient signals from disrupting contrast agent particles in an ultrasound field can potentially be used for perfusion quantification. Future developments to extract the blood flow signal from its noisy environment, aside from contrast agents, may be multiple sample volumes, frequency compounding and/or improved signal processing. The lack of an adequate perfusion phantom for verification of measurements of microcirculatory flow becomes, however, more apparent with improved detectability of slow flows.</p>},

@article{Hoskins_Review_Blood_Velocity,
   abstract = {Ultrasound systems can be used to investigate blood flow by use of the Doppler effect. The flow information may be displayed as either a real-time sonogram or a two-dimensional colour image. Estimates of maximum velocity using commercial systems are in error by typically 10–100 per cent; this is associated with the inability of the single-beam Doppler method to measure the true direction of flow, and with geometric spectral broadening. Vector Doppler systems acquire Doppler information along two beam directions and are able to measure accurately the velocity and direction of motion within the scan plane. The small beam width of modern Doppler systems means that the condition of uniform insonation, required for estimation of mean velocity from mean frequency shift, is not valid except for the very smallest vessels. Other quantities related to the velocity may also be estimated, such as the volumetric flow and wall shear stress. Flow visualization using colour flow imaging suffers from dependence of the displayed colour on the direction of blood motion. The vector Doppler technique may be extended to colour flow to give improved visualization of flow, in which there is no angle dependence within the scan plane.},

   abstract = {This PhD project investigates hardware strategies and imaging methods for hand-held ultrasound systems. The overall idea is to use a wireless ultrasound probe linked to general-purpose mobile devices for the processing and visualization. The approach has the potential to reduce the upfront costs of the ultrasound system and, consequently, to allow for a wide-scale utilization of diagnostic ultrasound in any medical specialties and out of the radiology department. The first part of the contribution deals with the study of hardware solutions for the reduction of the system complexity. Analog and digital beamforming strategies are simulated from a system-level perspective. The quality of the B-mode image is evaluated and the minimum specifications are derived for the design of a portable probe with integrated electronics in-handle. The system is based on a synthetic aperture sequential beamforming approach that allows to significantly reduce the data rate between the probe and processing unit. The second part investigates the feasibility of vector flow imaging in a hand-held ultrasound system. Vector flow imaging overcomes the limitations of conventional imaging methods in terms of flow angle compensation. Furthermore, high frame rate can be obtained by using synthetic aperture focusing techniques. A method is developed combining synthetic aperture sequential beamforming and directional transverse oscillation to achieve the wireless transmission of the data along with a relatively inexpensive 2-D velocity estimation. The performance of the method is thoroughly assessed through simulations and measurements, and in vivo investigations are carried out to show its potential in presence of complex flow dynamics. A sufficient frame rate is achieved to allow for the visualization of vortices in the carotid bifurcation. Furthermore, the method is implemented on a commercially available tablet to evaluate the real-time processing performance in the built-in GPU with concurrent wireless transmission of the data. Based on the demonstrations in this thesis, a flexible framework can be implemented with performance that can be scaled to the needs of the user and according to the computing resources available. The integration of high-frame-rate vector flow imaging in a hand-held ultrasound scanner, in addition, has the potential to improve the operators workflow and opens the way to new possibilities in the clinical practice. },

@thesis{Olesen_Thesis,
   abstract = {The main purpose of this PhD project was to develop an ultrasonic method capable of determining intravascular pressure changes non-invasively. Measuring pressure variations is used clinically as a diagnostic marker for the physiological state of a cardiovascular region. Current clinical procedures for assessing pressure changes are by means of invasive devices such as pressure sensing catheters. Such devices suffer severe limitations as they are invasive and require the use of ionizing radiation for guidance and positioning. To overcome the concerns related to the use of invasive pressure catheters this project introduces a method that derives pressure changes from 2-D vector velocity flow data acquired non-invasively. The method is based on the Navier-Stokes equations and is tested on fabricated flow models. Results from the flow models are compared with simulations from finite element modeling. The developed technique showed a standard deviation and bias across constricted flow domains of 9 % and 8 %, respectively. Finally, the first in-vivo examples of deriving pressure changes from 2-D vector velocity ultrasound data is presented. Based on the presented results it is concluded that non-invasive determination of pressure changes from 2-D flow data is feasible. However, when transferring the method into clinical practice, where blood vessels follow more complex flow geometries, the influence of out-of-plane flow movement becomes increasingly more important. Therefore, for scans using a 1-D transducer it is crucial that the out-of-plane flow component is negligible.},

@thesis{BrandtA_Thesis,
   abstract = {This Ph.D. project is based on a longstanding collaboration between physicists and engineers from the Center of Fast Ultrasound Imaging (CFU) at the Technical University of Denmark and medical doctors from the department of Radiology at Rigshospitalet. The intent of this cooperation is to validate new ultrasonic methods for future clinical use. Study I compares two B-mode ultrasound methods: the new experimental technique Synthetic Aperture Sequential Beamforming combined with Tissue Harmonic Imaging (SASB-THI), and a conventional technique combined with THI. While SASB reduces the amount of data transformation, thus enabling wireless transmission, THI can improve resolution and image contrast, and creates fewer artifacts. Thirty-one patients with verified liver tumors were scanned and recordings with and without visible pathology were performed. Subsequently, eight radiologists evaluated blinded to information about the technique, which B-mode images they preferred, as well as detection of pathology. Evaluation showed that the techniques were preferred equally and tumor could be detected equally well.Study II deals with the ability of vector flow imaging (VFI) to monitor patients with arteriovenous fistulas for hemodialysis for upcoming stenosis. VFI is an angle-independent method for determining blood flow direction and velocity. Volume can be determined by integrating the velocity profile multiplied by the cross-sectional area. Nineteen patients were monitored monthly over a period of six months, and VFI estimates were compared with the reference ultrasound dilution technique (UDT). VFI volume flow values were not significantly different from UDT and had a better precision. Concordance between VFI and UDT was high when large volume flow changes (greater than 25%) occurred between dialysis sessions. However, the methods could not be regarded as interchangeable. Study III deals with VFIs ability to determine peak velocity in the portal vein. The commonly used ultrasound method for this is spectral Doppler, which is known to overestimate peak velocity when the angle between the blood vessel and the beam is more than 70 degrees; this overestimation becomes even larger when the angle becomeslarger. VFI can determine the peak velocity angle independently. Thirty-two healthy volunteers were scanned with spectral Doppler and VFI with two portal vein scan positions (intercostal and subcostal). The study showed that VFI estimates the same peak velocity as spectral Doppler. Furthermore, VFI has better precision and can estimate the same peak velocity with a scan position, where spectral Doppler cannot. Finally, inter- and intraobserver agreement is higher for VFI. All three studies indicate that the techniques can be used in the clinic and probably will be part of everyday practice in the near future. },

In the first part the basic principles in conventional 1-D flow estimation are described, and the state of the art for 2-D velocity estimation is discussed. The TO method is introduced, and the basic theory behind the method is explained. This includes the creation of the acoustic fields, beamforming, echo-canceling and the velocity estimator.In the second part of the thesis the eight papers produced during this PhD project are presented. Here the TO method is tested both in simulations using the Field II program and in flow phantom experiments using the RASMUS scanner. Both simulations and flow phantom experiments indicate that the TO method can estimate the 2-D vector velocity with an acceptable low bias and standard deviation when the angle between the blood and the ultrasound beam is above 50^. Furthermore, the TO method is tested in-vivo where the scannings are performed by skilled sonographers. The in-vivo scannings resulted in a sequence of 2-D vector CFM images which showed 2-D flow patterns in the bifurcation of the carotid artery.},

@thesis{Ramin_Automatic_Ultrasound,
   abstract = {Medical ultrasound has been a widely used imaging modality in healthcare platforms for examination, diagnostic purposes, and for real-time guidance during surgery. However, despite the recent advances, medical ultrasound remains the most operator-dependent imaging modality, as it heavily relies on the user adjustments on the scanner interface to optimize the scan settings. This explains the huge interest in the subject of this PhD project entitled “AUTOMATIC ULTRASOUND SCANNING”. The key goals of the project have been to develop automated techniques to minimize the unnecessary settings on the scanners, and to improve the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in ultrasound by introducing new quantitative measures. Thus, four major issues concerning automation of the medicalultrasound are addressed in this PhD project. They touch upon gain adjustments in ultrasound, automatic synthetic aperture image quality optimization, automated vessel segmentation in ultrasound, and lack of CAD in point-of-care lung ultrasound. The goals of this PhD are achieved for each of the subjects. First, a new automated time gain compensation technique is proposed that compensates for gains of the scans in 2-D. The proposed model outperforms the current 1-D curve compensation in commercial scanners, as the 2-D topology of the scans are not fully integrated in those techniques.Second, an automated generic technique is proposed for optimization of synthetic aperture image quality. This generic model can be used for any imaging regime using any transducer geometry. Third, a hybrid vessel segmentation technique is proposed that combines both vector velocity estimates (VFI) and B-mode images. The technique enables the wall-to-wall visualization of VFI, as well as provides a firm ground for quantitative quantification of VFI in state-of-the-art US scanners. Finally, a new technique is introduced to detect disease-related reverberation artifacts in lung ultrasound, thereby exploiting the full potential of this imaging modality.},

Usually, this “wall filter” is implemented as either a conventional FIR or IIR filter. Unfortunately, in the case of very low velocity flow, these wall filters may remove signals from the moving scatterers of interest. In this work we present a novel filtering scheme that involves first shifting (via a complex multiplication) the undesired signals to zero frequency and then removing these signals by simply subtracting the average of these signals from each of them. The result is a high-pass filter which is very narrow, yet does not reduce the number of samples available to the autocorrelation velocity estimator},

   abstract = {A blood mimicking fluid (BMF) is imperative for the evaluation of Doppler ultrasound. Doppler ultrasound still causes errors due to some artifacts such as aliasing and presence of grating lobes. One of the other velocimeters is the optical particle image velocimeter (PIV). This study initially developed an in vitro measurement system for analyzing flowing BMF with ultrasonic and optical PIVs. The acoustic properties such as speed of sound, attenuation, and backscatter coefficient of BMF equivalent to the human blood, used for both ultrasonic and optical PIVs were analyzed in a frequency range of 4–12 MHz. The velocity profiles were estimated by ultrasonic and optical PIVs using a block matching method. A difference between velocities obtained by ultrasonic and optical data was within 4.0% using BMF with 20 μm polyamide particle at 0.2% concentration that realized the acoustic properties and speckle patterns similar to those in ultrafast ultrasound blood flow imaging.},

Intrusive lesions on arterial walls give rise to an alteration of the time-varying blood velocity waveform and local blood flow disturbance which are detected and measured using the envelope and width of the Doppler signal spectrogram respectively. Flow may also be imaged in colour superimposed on a grey-scale anatomical image allowing vessel narrowing and the accompanying flow disturbance to be visualized. Developments in three-dimensional imaging, angle tolerant velocity measurements and increased sensitivity using second harmonic backscatter from encapsulated-bubble contrast media ensure increasing use of this modality.},

   abstract = {Visualization of, and measurements related to, haemodynamic phenomena in arteries may be made using ultrasound systems. Most ultrasound technology relies on simple measurements of blood velocity taken from a single site, such as the peak systolic velocity for assessment of the degree of lumen reduction caused by an arterial stenosis. Real-time two-dimensional (2D) flow field visualization is possible using several methods, such as colour flow, blood flow imaging, and echo particle image velocimetry; these have applications in the examination of the flow field in diseased arteries and in heart chambers. Three-dimensional (3D) and four-dimensional ultrasound systems have been described. These have been used to provide 2D velocity profile data for the estimation of volumetric flow. However, they are limited for haemodynamic evaluation in that they provide only one component of the velocity. The provision of all seven components (three space, three velocity, and one time) is possible using image-guided modelling, in which 3D ultrasound is combined with computational fluid dynamics. This method also allows estimation of turbulence data and of relevant quantities such as the wall shear stress.},

@article{Overview_Emerging_Imaging,
   abstract = {From times immemorial manual palpation served as a source of information on the state of soft tissues and allowed detection of various diseases accompanied by changes in tissue elasticity. During the last two decades, the ancient art of palpation gained new life due to numerous emerging elasticity imaging (EI) methods. Areas of applications of EI in medical diagnostics and treatment monitoring are steadily expanding. Elasticity imaging methods are emerging as commercial applications, a true testament to the progress and importance of the field.In this paper we present a brief history and theoretical basis of EI, describe various techniques of EI and, analyze their advantages and limitations, and overview main clinical applications. We present a classification of elasticity measurement and imaging techniques based on the methods used for generating a stress in the tissue (external mechanical force, internal ultrasound radiation force, or an internal endogenous force), and measurement of the tissue response. The measurement method can be performed using differing physical principles including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound imaging, X-ray imaging, optical and acoustic signals.Until recently, EI was largely a research method used by a few select institutions having the special equipment needed to perform the studies. Since 2005 however, increasing numbers of mainstream manufacturers have added EI to their ultrasound systems so that today the majority of manufacturers offer some sort of Elastography or tissue stiffness imaging on their clinical systems. Now it is safe to say that some sort of elasticity imaging may be performed on virtually all types of focal and diffuse disease. Most of the new applications are still in the early stages of research, but a few are becoming common applications in clinical practice.},

   abstract = {Ionizing radiation has long been known to increase the risk of cancer. X-rays and γ-rays are officially classified as a carcinogen by the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer.1 Of the 5 billion imaging investigations performed worldwide two-thirds employ ionizing radiation.2 Diagnostic x-rays are the largest man-made source of radiation exposure to the general population, and computed tomography (CT) represents the largest proportion of these.3 Diagnostic CT has seen a dramatic increase in applications in the last two decades, not least in the higher dose applications. Whilst the increased use of CT has undoubtedly been of patient benefit, it inevitably will be associated with an increase in malignancy due to medical exposure. In fact a recent study from the USA has estimated that the CT examinations performed in 2007 could result in 29,000 future cancers based on current risk estimations.4 Whilst the numbers in the UK will be less (only 4 million examinations are performed compared to 70 million), it is clear that it is the responsibility of all radiologists to carefully examine their CT techniques and protocols with the aim to reduce the dose of examinations without compromising their accuracy. Cardiac computed tomographic angiography (CTA) initially was a very high dose application. However, both clinicians and CT system manufacturers have done a large amount of work to reduce dose. Dramatic changes have been achieved and the aim of this review is to highlight these. However, such developments are not exclusively applicable to cardiac CTA and many can be utilized in CT in general.},

This study aimed to analyze the workload trends in radiology during the last decade, including the impact of COVID-19 in a single university hospital in Poland and to identify possible solutions to the challenges that radiology could face in the future. We compared the annual amount of computed tomography (CT), radiography (X-ray), and ultrasound (US) examinations performed between the years 2010 and 2020 and analyzed the changes in the number of practicing radiologists in Poland. The mean number of patients treated in our hospital was 60,727 per year. During the last decade, the number of CT and US examinations nearly doubled (from 87.4 to 155.7 and from 52.1 to 86.5 per 1000 patients in 2010 and 2020 respectively), while X-ray examinations decreased from 115.1 to 96.9 per 1000 patients. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic did not change the workload trends as more chest examinations were performed. AI, which contributed to the COVID-19 diagnosis, could aid radiologists in the future with the growing workload by increasing the efficiency of radiology departments as well as by potentially minimizing the related costs.},

   abstract = {In this PhD project new ultrasound techniques for blood flow measurements have been investigated in-vivo. The focus has mainly been on vector velocity techniques and four different approaches have been examined: Transverse Oscillation, Synthetic Transmit Aperture, Directional Beamforming and Plane Wave Excitation. Furthermore two different adaptive spectral estimators have been investigated: Blood spectral Power Capon method (BPC) and Blood Amplitude and Phase Estimation method (BAPES). The novel techniques investigated in this thesis are developed to circumvent some of the main limitations in conventional Doppler ultrasound. That is angle dependency, reduced temporal resolution and low frame rate. Transverse Oscillation, Synthetic Transmit Aperture and Directional Beamforming can estimate the blood velocity angle independently. The three methods were validated in-vivo against magnetic resonance phase contrast angiography when measuring stroke volumes in simple vessel geometry on 11 volunteers. Using linear regression and Bland-Altman analyses good agreements were found, indicating that vector velocity methods can be used for quantitative blood flow measurements. Plane Wave Excitation can estimate blood velocities angle independently with a high frame rate. Complex vessel geometries in the cardiovascular system were explored in-vivo on four volunteers using the technique. Flow patterns previously visualized with magnetic resonance angiography and predicted by models of computational fluid dynamics, were shown for the first time with ultrasound. Additionally, new information on complex flow patterns in bifurcations and around venous valves was discovered. BPC and BAPES are adaptive spectral estimators which can produce spectrograms with a high temporal resolution. Spectrograms obtained in-vivo with the two techniques on ten volunteers were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively and compared to the conventional spectral Doppler method. Descriptive statistics, kappa statistics and multiple t-tests were performed and it was shown that BAPES and BPC can produce useful spectrograms with a narrower observation window compared to the conventional spectral Doppler method. The thesis shows, that novel information can be obtained with vector velocity methods providing quantitative estimates of blood flow and insight in to the complexity of fluid dynamics. This could give the clinician a new tool in assessment and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Also solutions to produce spectrograms with fewer emissions per estimate were given. This could potentially bring improvements to spectral blood estimation as an increase of the temporal resolution of the spectrogram or as an increase of the frame rate for the interleaved B-mode images.},

These techniques, referred to as retrospective B-scan imaging (RBI) and retrospective color flow imaging (RCFI) are based on the use of the electrocardiogram (ECG) to trigger signal acquisitions. B-scan and color flow images are reconstructed by retrospectively assembling the processed data on a line-by-line basis. Retrospective techniques are used to produce the first in vivo B-scan and color flow images of mouse carotid arteries at frame rates up to 10,000 fps. Retrospective B-scan images of mouse heart were also produced at frame rates of 1000 fps using a version of RBI implemented on a commercial imaging system (Vevo660, VisualSonics, Toronto, ON, Canada). This technology enables detailed in vivo biomechanical studies of dynamic tissues such as the myocardium of the mouse heart with high temporal resolution.

   abstract = {Integrated analog front ends (AFEs) are often the preferred choice when designing ultrasound systems. They are convenient, easy to use packages, however do not yet provide the performance needed for high-frequency, wide-bandwidth ultrasound applications e.g. Pre-clinical imaging. These applications require higher sampling frequencies and increased levels of gain than are currently available in commercial AFEs. For high frequency systems it is therefore necessary to design a custom high-frequency AFE. This work reports on a scalable AFE design suited to wide-bandwidth applications. The AFE design is composed of a transmit/receive switch (TX810), a 43.5 dB low noise amplifier (AD8334), channel multiplexer (AD8184), a variable gain amplifier suitable for time gain compensation (THS7530), and a passive filter(9th order Chebyshev). The performance of the AFE design is verified in SPICE and measured using a network analyzer. Results show a 65 MHz-3 dB input bandwidth with an overall gain of 75 dB, smooth phase response and a minimal detectable voltage of 65 μV. The scalable design is suitable for replication across many channels of an imaging system, and has been designed to interface with the existing UARP system (University of Leeds, UK). © 2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Access to the pre-beamform data of each array channel on an ultrasound scanner is important to experimental investigations on advanced imaging research topics like adaptive beamforming and synthetic aperture imaging. Through such data access, we can obtain in-vitro or in-vivo insights on various imaging methods without resorting to hardware implementation. This paper reports the development of a pre-beamform data acquisition (DAQ) system that can collect data from 128 array elements in parallel. Our DAQ system is intended to interface with a Sonix-RP research scanner through a probe connector port. It comprises three major blocks: 1) a connector board that interfaces with the array probe and the scanner; 2) a main board that triggers data acquisition and controls data transfer to a computer; 3) four receiver boards that are each responsible for acquiring 32 channels of digitized raw data and storing them to the on-board DDR2 memory. The probe-connecting end of this system is interfaced with TX810 chips to facilitate switching between transmit and receive modes. When receiving data, the incoming analog signal is first passed into a low-noise amplifier. These signals are then sent into AD9272 chips on the four receiver boards to perform time gain compensation, anti-alias filtering, and 12-bit data sampling at an 80MHz rate. Subsequently, the digitized signal samples are de-serialized using a Virtex-5 FPGA and are stored into DDR2 memory. To facilitate data retrieval, we implemented a Virtex-5 FPGA on the main board to initiate data transfer, and if preferred, to perform onboard beamforming (programmable by user) prior to sending data to a computer through a USB 2.0 link. For our prototype, we used 16GB of DDR2 memory for data storage. With a frame rate of 35Hz, a 10cm depth-of-view and 128 transmit firings per frame, this DAQ system is capable of collecting pre-beamform data from all array channels for 2.5 seconds. We are currently completing the prototype development in collaboration with Ultrasonix. ©2009 IEEE.},

This paper presents a prototype of a reconfigurable, high performance, low cost and real-time Ultrasonic Signal Acquisition and Processing (USAP) platform based on Zynq System-on-Chip (SoC). The USAP platform consists of five major components: Multi-level voltage power supply; High voltage pulse generation; Ultrasonic signal acquisition; Sampling control unit and Digital signal processing module. The system uses Xilinx Zynq SoC as main processor and controller. It combines both ARM processor and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) on the same chip, which makes the system capable of doing complex system configuration and performing high speed data processing. With this arrangement, the developed system is highly reconfigurable, where software and hardware configuration can be changed on both ARM and FPGA. This paper presents a system design flow of a complete ultrasonic testing system which is capable of acquiring ultrasonic data and performing advanced signal processing algorithms in real-time.},

   abstract = {Ultrasonic industrial and medical imaging applications involve acquisition of large amount of volumetric data in real time. Therefore, data storage becomes critical in many current day applications which utilise ultrasound technology. Compressing the acquired data allows possessing minimal storage and also helps to rapidly transmit information to remote locations for expert analysis. The objective of this study is to design computationally efficient architectures for implementing discrete wavelet transform-based ultrasonic three-dimensional (3D) data compression algorithm on a reconfigurable ultrasonic system-on-chip (SoC) hardware platform. In this study, hardware and software architectures of the 3D ultrasonic compression algorithm are realised using Xilinx Zynq all programmable SoC. This study demonstrates that, compressing 33 MB of experimental ultrasonic 3D data into 0.42 MB (98.7% compression) requires only 84 ms for hardware architecture, and 1 min for software architecture, making both designs highly suitable for real-time ultrasonic imaging applications. Furthermore, the 3D compression is implemented by using Open Computing Language (OpenCL) targeted on Nvidia GT 750M graphical processing unit. OpenCL implementation of ultrasonic 3D compression algorithm completes the execution in <1 sec. This approach provides improved computational performance as that of hardware architecture, and comparable flexibility as that of software implementation.},

The time of development of valvular movements is determined; a wide range of variation under various conditions is shown. 3. 3. In cases of coronary sclerosis, hypertension, etc., the opening of the mitral valve is delayed, revealing a prolonged duration of isometric relaxation. The abnormalities develop prior to myocardial change in the ECG. 4. 4. In cases of mitral stenosis the closing of the mitral valve is delayed and the opening is quickened, showing the shortening of isometric relaxation. 5. 5. In cases of mitral valvular disease with auricular fibrillation the shorter the preceding R-R, the more delayed is the closing of the mitral valve. 6. 6. Prolonged isometric relaxation develops even in cases of nephritis, hypothyroidism, liver disease, etc. 7. 7. The time relationship between the opening of the mitral valve, the closing of the semilunar valves, and the end of the T wave is referable to the following modes: (a) a delayed opening of the mitral valve; (b) early development of the opening of the mitral valve; (c) early development of the closing of the semilunar valves (Hegglin syndrome); (d) coexistence of (a) and (c); (e) early development of the opening of the mitral valve subsequent to early development of the closing of the semilunar valves in cases of marked Hegglin syndrome. © 1961.},

The key elements of the micropump are the micro check valves, which are fabricated in a 100-μm-thick SU-8 film. The SU-8 part is designed as a disc with 10-mm diameter. The check valves are 1-mm discs suspended on a compliant orthoplanar spring with four arms. The cross section of the spring beam has a dimension of 100μm×100μm. The pump is designed as a stack of different layers, which are made of PMMA and SU-8. In contrast to their silicon counterparts, the low spring constant of the SU-8 check valves allows the use of relatively low drive voltages on the order of several 10V for the piezodisc, which works as the pump’s actuator. Pump rates up to 1ml/min and back pressures up to 200mm water have been achieved. The pump design shows the feasibility of our current effort to make microfluidic systems based on the lamination of different polymeric materials.},

The disc is suspended on folded beams, which act as valve springs. Both valve disc and springs are fabricated in a 100 µm SU-8 layer. The valves prove a clear flow rectification function. Relatively low pressure is required for opening the valve. The valves were tested and characterized with water. One of the valves is successfully integrated into a polymeric micropump.

@article{polymer_amanda,
   abstract = {A normally-closed piezo-driven micro valve for gases and liquids has been developed. Due to the small deflection of piezo-actuated bending disks made of PZT a hydraulic transmission was constructed, which increases the displacement of the piezo disk up to the 25-fold. The switching times of the valve are shorter than 1.8ms. Silicone gel serves as a transition medium in the hydraulic. It simplifies the manufacturing process and allows a flexible adaptation to different pressure requirements up to a differential pressure of 150kPa switched with 300V. Additionally, this silicone gel supports the sealing of the valve so it achieves an open-to-close ratio of 1:150,000 or higher. The overall dimensions of the valve are 13mm × 13mm × 3mm, the dead volume is 0.33μl, and the inner diameter of the valve seat is 200μm. A transformer as small as the micro valve is able to produce driving voltages of up to 300V with a response time of 2ms. Therefore, the valve could be integrated into hand-held systems which are battery powered with 5-15V. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {A piezoelectrically driven hydraulic amplification microvalve for use in compact high-performance hydraulic pumping systems was designed, fabricated, and experimentally characterized. High-frequency, high-force actuation capabilities were enabled through the incorporation of bulk piezoelectric material elements beneath a micromachined annular tethered-piston structure. Large valve stroke at the microscale was achieved with an hydraulic amplification mechanism that amplified (40× - 50×) the limited stroke of the piezoelectric material into a significantly larger motion of a micromachined valve membrane with attached valve cap. These design features enabled the valve to meet simultaneously a set of high frequency (≥1 kHz), high pressure(≥300 kPa), and large stroke (20-30 μm) requirements not previously satisfied by other hydraulic flow regulation microvalves. This paper details the design, modeling, fabrication, assembly, and experimental characterization of this valve device. Fabrication challenges, such as deep-reactive ion etching of the piston and valve membrane structures, wafer-level silicon-to-silicon fusion bonding, wafer-level and die-level silicon-to-glass anodic bonding, preparation and integration of piezoelectric material elements within the micromachined tethered piston structure, and filling of degassed fluid within the hydraulic amplification chamber are detailed.},

A modified Bouc-Wen non-symmetric model is applied to study the behaviour of the system in static and dynamic state. The good agreement between predicted and measured curve showed that the Bouc-Wen model is an effective mean for modelling the hysteresis of piezoelectric actuator system. Subsequently, the inverse Bouc-Wen model is formulated and applied to cancel the non-linear hysteresis. In perspective of a control design, it is desirable to linearize the non-linear Bouc-Wen model to produce a static system. Finally, in order to increase damping of the actuator system and to improve the control accuracy, a cascaded PID controller is designed with consideration of the dynamics and static behaviour of the actuator. Experiment result shows that error is of only 5% if PID is cascaded with hysteresis compensation. Therefore, hysteresis compensation with PID controller greatly improves the micromanipulation accuracy of the microgripper actuated by piezoelectric stack.},

   abstract = {The fabrication of an active MEMS microvalve driven by integrated bulk single crystal piezoelectric actuators is reported. The valve has a nine-layer structure composed of glass, silicon, and silicon on insulator (SOI) layers assembled by wafer-level fusion bonding and anodic bonding, as well as die-level anodic bonding and eutectic bonding. Valve head strokes as large as 20μm were realized through hydraulic amplification of the small stroke of the piezoelectric actuator. A flow rate of 0.21ml/s was obtained at 1kHz. The fabrication, bonding and assembly process, as well as some test results are described. © 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.},
